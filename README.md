Hi, there! Welcome to my museum of some of the single-page apps and other code ramblings I've done in the 5+ years of web life.

If SPAs were flicks, here you'd find a bit of every genre:

- 🎥 &nbsp;[Documentary](https://hqcasanova.github.io/unsplash) - Vue 3 (WIP)
- 📝 &nbsp;[Narrative](https://hqcasanova.github.io/react-task) - React 18 (WIP)
- 👽 &nbsp;[Sci-Fi](https://hqcasanova.github.io/react-graphql) - React 18 (WIP)
- 💰 &nbsp;[Financial thriller](https://hqcasanova.github.io/react-app) - React 18
- 🕵️‍♀️ &nbsp;[Mystery](https://hqcasanova.github.io/pin-pad) - Vue 3
- 🎵 &nbsp;[Musical](https://hqcasanova.github.io/interactive-matcher) - Angular 12

If you aren't into movies, how about a round of good old [tic-tac-toe](http://hqcasanova.github.io/DOM-and-jQuery-basics/), pre-flexbox edition? 🤪 &nbsp;Enjoy!
