Hi, there! Welcome to my museum of some of the single-page apps and other code ramblings I've done in the 5+ years of web life.

If SPAs were flicks, here you'd find a bit of every genre:
- 🕵️‍♀️ &nbsp;[Mystery](https://hqcasanova.github.io/pin-pad)
- 🎵 &nbsp;[Musical](https://hqcasanova.github.io/interactive-matcher)
- 📜 &nbsp;[Biopic](https://hqcasanova.github.io)

If you aren't into movies, how about a round of good old [tic-tac-toe](http://hqcasanova.github.io/DOM-and-jQuery-basics/), pre-flexbox edition? 🤪 &nbsp;Enjoy!
